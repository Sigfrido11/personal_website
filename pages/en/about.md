## Get to Know Me

Since I was a kid I have been hopelessly in love with science. I fondly remember the hours spent watching astrophysics documentaries and tearing up when a space mission succeeded after years of waiting. My passion for physics truly blossomed a little later, thanks to an extraordinary teacher in my small provincial high school. He was the first to show me how familiar phenomena can hide unexpected, counter‑intuitive surprises. I vividly recall the joy I felt when, with very simple calculations, he proved that objects in a vacuum fall with the same acceleration regardless of mass and explained how trees move water to their tops using capillarity.

### Personality

People usually notice that I am quite introverted, but I manage well in small groups and I’m improving at handling larger settings. What I’m most proud of is my innate curiosity: I love asking questions about almost everything, even far beyond my areas of expertise. I like to think I’m kind and polite, though sometimes a bit too meticulous and stubborn.

I’m also considered generous; I often invest a lot of energy in explaining concepts I feel I’ve mastered to anyone who wants a hand. Teaching others helps me realise I’m often explaining things to myself too.

### What I Enjoy

Reading is my main interest right now. I’m learning to enjoy both novels and essays on varied topics and have recently developed a taste for sci‑fi and dystopian fiction. The essays I gravitate toward are usually about psychology and philosophy, but I try to keep up with history and absorb the basics of politics and economics.

I played basketball for several years, but cycling and the gym are the sports I practise most now. I’ve also developed a passion for model building and woodworking, even if I’m still very much a beginner.
